This repository document some meta-heuristic assignments when I am studying my graduate degree.
---
ABC.py : Use **ABC(Artificial Bee Colony)** to resolve Rastrigin and STYBLINSKI-TANG function.
FA.py : Use **FA(Firefly algorithm)** to resolve Rastrigin and STYBLINSKI-TANG function.
GA.py : Use **GA(Genetic algorithm)** to resolve Polynomial.
nomad_algorithm.py : The algorithm developed by myself, details can be found in nomad_algorithm.docx and nomad_algorithm.pptx.
PSO.py : Use **PSO(Particle Swarm Optimization)** to resolve Rastrigin and STYBLINSKI-TANG function.
TSP.py : Use **TS(Tabu Search)** to resolve the TSP(Travelling salesman problem, TSP).
TSP_exhaustive_enumeration.py : Exhaustive enumeration all possible results to compared with TS method in TSP.py.
